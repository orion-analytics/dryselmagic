__Note__ : DrySelMagic is a proof of concept at present.

# [DrySel](https://github.com/orion-analytics/drysel)
“Automate the (Test) Automation”. “DrySel” is a family of test automation frameworks and tools, developed based on the fundamental software engineering principle “Don’t Repeat Yourself”. It aims to eleminate writing "Selenium/WebDriver" specific code, or even further, it aims to eleminate writing any "programming" code from UI Test Automation. 

## DrySelMagic
"DrySelMagic" the ultimate tool for UI Automation. It removes the need to write “boiler-plate” code from both of ["DrySelCore"](https://github.com/orion-analytics/dryselcore) and ["DrySelJSON"](https://github.com/orion-analytics/dryseljson) frameworks. Now, anyone can automate UI-Testing without writing a single line of programming code..
